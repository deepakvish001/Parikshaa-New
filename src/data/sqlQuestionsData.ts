     answer: `## What is SQL?
 
 **SQL (Structured Query Language)** is the standard language for interacting with relational database management systems (RDBMS).
 
 ### Key Operations (CRUD)
 - **C**reate: \`INSERT INTO\`
 - **R**ead: \`SELECT\`
 - **U**pdate: \`UPDATE\`
 - **D**elete: \`DELETE\`
 
 ### Why SQL is Important
 1. **Universal Standard**: Works across MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle
 2. **Data Integrity**: Enforces constraints and relationships
 3. **Scalability**: Handles millions of records efficiently
 4. **Analytics**: Powerful aggregation and reporting capabilities
 
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Basic example
 SELECT first_name, last_name, email
 FROM users
 WHERE status = 'active'
 ORDER BY created_at DESC;

     answer: `## Types of SQL Commands
 
 ### 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)
 Defines database structure:
 \`\`\`sql
 CREATE TABLE users (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100));
 ALTER TABLE users ADD email VARCHAR(255);
 DROP TABLE users;
 TRUNCATE TABLE users;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)
 Manipulates data:
 \`\`\`sql
 INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'John');
 UPDATE users SET name = 'Jane' WHERE id = 1;
 DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 3. DQL (Data Query Language)
 Retrieves data:
 \`\`\`sql
 SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 4. DCL (Data Control Language)
 Controls access:
 \`\`\`sql
 GRANT SELECT ON users TO analyst;
 REVOKE DELETE ON users FROM intern;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)
 Manages transactions:
 \`\`\`sql
 BEGIN TRANSACTION;
 COMMIT;
 ROLLBACK;
 SAVEPOINT checkpoint1;

     difficulty: "Easy",
     categoryId: "basics",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## NULL Values in SQL
 
 **NULL** represents the absence of a value - it's not zero, empty string, or false.
 
 ### Checking for NULL
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Correct way
 SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone IS NULL;
 SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
 
 -- Wrong way (won't work!)
 SELECT * FROM users WHERE phone = NULL;  -- Always returns empty
 \`\`\`
 
 ### NULL in Expressions
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Any operation with NULL returns NULL
 SELECT 5 + NULL;          -- Returns NULL
 SELECT 'Hello' || NULL;   -- Returns NULL
 
 -- Use COALESCE to handle NULL
 SELECT COALESCE(phone, 'N/A') FROM users;
 SELECT COALESCE(discount, 0) * price FROM products;

     answer: `## Primary Key vs Foreign Key
 
 ### Primary Key
 - Uniquely identifies each row
 - Cannot be NULL
 - Only one per table
 
 \`\`\`sql
 CREATE TABLE users (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL
 );
 \`\`\`
 
 ### Foreign Key
 - References primary key of another table
 - Enforces referential integrity
 - Can be NULL (optional relationship)
 
 \`\`\`sql
 CREATE TABLE orders (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id INT REFERENCES users(id),
     total DECIMAL(10, 2)

     title: "What is normalization in SQL?",
     text: "Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It divides tables into smaller, related tables and uses relationships to maintain data consistency. The main forms include 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.",
     difficulty: "Medium",
     categoryId: "database-design",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## Database Normalization
 
 Normalization eliminates data redundancy and ensures data integrity through progressive normal forms.
 
 ### 1NF (First Normal Form)
 - Eliminate repeating groups
 - Each cell contains single value
 
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Violates 1NF (multiple values in one cell)
 | id | phones              |
 |----|---------------------|
 | 1  | 555-1234, 555-5678  |
 
 -- 1NF Compliant
 | id | phone    |
 |----|----------|
 | 1  | 555-1234 |
 | 1  | 555-5678 |
 \`\`\`
 
 ### 2NF (Second Normal Form)
 - Must be in 1NF
 - All non-key attributes depend on entire primary key
 
 ### 3NF (Third Normal Form)
 - Must be in 2NF
 - No transitive dependencies
 
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Violates 3NF
 | order_id | customer_id | customer_name |
 
 -- 3NF Compliant (separate tables)
 orders: order_id, customer_id
 customers: customer_id, customer_name

     difficulty: "Medium",
     categoryId: "database-design",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## Denormalization
 
 **Denormalization** intentionally adds redundancy to optimize read performance.
 
 ### When to Denormalize
 - Read-heavy workloads (analytics, reporting)
 - Complex joins causing performance issues
 - Real-time dashboards needing fast queries
 
 ### Example
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Normalized (requires JOIN)
 SELECT o.id, o.total, c.name
 FROM orders o
 JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
 
 -- Denormalized (faster read, redundant data)
 SELECT id, total, customer_name
 FROM orders_denormalized;

     difficulty: "Easy",
     categoryId: "joins",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## SQL Joins
 
 Joins combine data from two or more tables based on a related column.
 
 ### Types of Joins
 
 \`\`\`sql
 -- INNER JOIN: Only matching rows
 SELECT u.name, o.total
 FROM users u
 INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;
 
 -- LEFT JOIN: All left + matching right

 -- FULL OUTER JOIN: All from both
 SELECT u.name, o.total
 FROM users u
 FULL OUTER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

     answer: `## LEFT JOIN vs RIGHT JOIN
 
 ### LEFT JOIN
 Returns **all rows from left table** + matching rows from right.
 
 \`\`\`sql
 -- All users, with their orders (if any)
 SELECT u.name, o.total

     type: "query",
     answer: `## Common Table Expression (CTE)
 
 A CTE is a temporary, named result set defined within a query using the \`WITH\` clause.
 
 ### Basic Syntax
 \`\`\`sql
 WITH cte_name AS (
     SELECT column1, column2
     FROM table
     WHERE condition
 )
 SELECT * FROM cte_name;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### Benefits
 1. **Readability**: Break complex queries into logical parts
 2. **Reusability**: Reference the CTE multiple times
 3. **Recursion**: Can be self-referencing
 
 ### Example: Multiple CTEs
 \`\`\`sql
 WITH 
 high_value_orders AS (
     SELECT user_id, SUM(total) as order_total
     FROM orders
     GROUP BY user_id
     HAVING SUM(total) > 1000
 ),
 active_users AS (
     SELECT id, name, email
     FROM users
     WHERE last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
 )
 SELECT au.name, au.email, hvo.order_total
 FROM active_users au
 JOIN high_value_orders hvo ON au.id = hvo.user_id;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### Recursive CTE
 \`\`\`sql
 WITH RECURSIVE hierarchy AS (
     -- Base case
     SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 as level
     FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL
     
     UNION ALL
     
     -- Recursive case
     SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, h.level + 1
     FROM employees e
     JOIN hierarchy h ON e.manager_id = h.id
 )
 SELECT * FROM hierarchy;

     difficulty: "Medium",
     categoryId: "indexing",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## Database Indexes
 
 An **index** is a data structure (typically B-tree) that speeds up data retrieval.
 
 ### Creating Indexes
 \`\`\`sql
 -- Single column index
 CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
 
 -- Composite index (order matters!)
 CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_date ON orders(user_id, created_at);
 
 -- Unique index
 CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
 
 -- Partial index (PostgreSQL)
 CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users(email) WHERE active = true;
 \`\`\`
 
 ### When to Index
 ✅ **Do Index:**
 - Columns in WHERE clauses
 - JOIN columns
 - ORDER BY columns
 - Foreign keys
 
 ❌ **Avoid Indexing:**
 - Small tables
 - Frequently updated columns
 - Low cardinality columns (boolean, status)

     difficulty: "Medium",
     categoryId: "transactions",
     type: "conceptual",
     answer: `## ACID Properties
 
 ACID ensures reliable transaction processing in databases.
 
 ### A - Atomicity
 "All or nothing" - transaction either completes fully or not at all.
 
 \`\`\`sql
 BEGIN TRANSACTION;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
 COMMIT; -- Both succeed or both fail
 \`\`\`
 
 ### C - Consistency
 Database moves from one valid state to another. All rules, constraints, and triggers are satisfied.
 
 ### I - Isolation
 Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other.
 
 **Isolation Levels:**
 1. READ UNCOMMITTED (lowest)
 2. READ COMMITTED
 3. REPEATABLE READ
 4. SERIALIZABLE (highest)
 
 ### D - Durability
 Once committed, data persists even after system failure.
 
 ### Example
 \`\`\`sql
 BEGIN;
     -- Transfer $500 from account A to B
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 'A';
     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 'B';

     answer: `## GROUP BY Clause
 
 GROUP BY combines rows with identical values in specified columns and allows aggregate calculations per group.
 
 ### Basic Syntax
 \`\`\`sql
 SELECT column, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column)

 #### ❌ Avoid SELECT *
 \`\`\`sql

     answer: `## Transaction Isolation Levels
 
 Isolation levels control visibility of changes between concurrent transactions.
 
 ### The Four Levels
 
 | Level | Dirty Read | Non-Repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
 |-------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
 | READ UNCOMMITTED | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
 | READ COMMITTED | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
 | REPEATABLE READ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |

 - **Dirty Read**: Reading uncommitted data from another transaction
 - **Non-Repeatable Read**: Same query returns different values within a transaction
 - **Phantom Read**: New rows appear between two identical queries
