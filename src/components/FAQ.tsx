  {
    question: "What is Parikshaa?",
    answer:
      "Parikshaa is an all-in-one platform that combines a free learning hub for students with a serious assessment & proctoring suite for colleges and companies. Learners practice DSA, SQL, system design, and aptitude; teams run secure, proctored coding rounds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Parikshaa free for students?",
    answer:
      "Yes — the entire learning side is free. You get curated DSA sheets, daily challenges, contests, an AI mentor, progress tracking, streaks, and leaderboards with no credit card required.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does proctoring work for assessments?",
    answer:
      "Parikshaa runs entirely in the browser with built-in tab-switch detection, fullscreen enforcement, event logging, and our Side Eye AI which uses your phone as a side camera. Every attempt produces a single integrity score backed by a verifiable event log.",
  },
  {
    question: "What question types can I include in a test?",
    answer:
      "Coding (with auto-grading and run-against-tests), MCQs, SQL with live execution, and long-form subjective questions — all in a single assessment. You can mix and match per section.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do colleges and companies invite candidates?",
    answer:
      "Paste a CSV or list of emails and every candidate gets a unique join link in seconds. Each invite is single-use, identity-bound, and tied to your organization slug.",
  },
  {
    question: "What DSA and interview content is available?",
    answer:
      "Striver SDE & A2Z, NeetCode 150 & 250, Blind 75, company-wise sheets, SQL question banks, system design, aptitude, and interview question libraries — all with built-in progress tracking and spaced repetition.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does progress tracking and gamification work?",
    answer:
      "Mark problems as solved or for revision and your progress syncs in real time. A GitHub-style heatmap shows daily activity, streaks keep you accountable, and an XP system unlocks 20 levels and achievement badges.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Parikshaa work on mobile?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The learning experience is fully responsive across phone, tablet, and desktop, and your data syncs in real time. Proctored assessments are best taken on a laptop or desktop with a webcam.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is Parikshaa's proctoring and what does it actually detect?",
    answer:
      "Our proctoring stack runs entirely in-browser — no plugins, no kernel drivers — and captures a wide event surface in real time:\n\n• Window & focus: tab switches, window blur, fullscreen exits, devtools open, alt-tab and Cmd-Tab attempts.\n• Input behavior: copy / paste / cut, keystroke cadence anomalies, paste-from-clipboard with source-type sniffing, suspicious paste bursts.\n• Vision: missing face, multiple faces, face-swap / static-image spoofing, head pose drift, gaze off-screen for sustained windows.\n• Audio: background voices, conversation overlap, repeated whispers, third-party noise correlation.\n• Network & device: screen-share drops, VM / emulator fingerprints, virtual camera detection, IP / geo deltas mid-test.\n• Side Eye AI side camera: pairs the candidate's phone via QR to capture the side angle — detects phone usage, second monitor, off-camera helpers, and printed cheat-sheets.\n\nEvery event is timestamped, hashed, and chained into a tamper-evident log so a single edited entry breaks the chain — auditors can verify the log integrity after the test independently of Parikshaa.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the integrity score work?",
    answer:
      "Each attempt produces one 0–100 integrity score with a full per-signal breakdown — no black-box flags. The score combines five weighted streams:\n\n1. Proctoring events (35%) — severity-weighted, decayed over session length.\n2. Typing & coding behavior (20%) — paste vs. type ratio, keystroke entropy, copy-paste run length, AI-generation fingerprints.\n3. Cross-submission similarity (20%) — token-level + AST-level similarity vs. cohort and historical corpus.\n4. Identity verification (15%) — selfie ↔ ID match score plus continuous face-presence confidence.\n5. Side Eye sweep (10%) — room scan, phone movement, off-camera object detection.\n\nThresholds are configurable per org: you can set 'placement-drive' (strict, auto-flag below 70), 'practice' (lenient), or fully custom. Every score links back to the raw events so reviewers can drill in instead of just trusting the number.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I export reports for placement cells, hiring managers, or auditors?",
    answer:
      "Yes — exports are first-class, not an afterthought.\n\nCandidate-level (PDF + CSV):\n• Final score, section breakdown, time per question.\n• Integrity score with per-signal breakdown.\n• Full event timeline with timestamps and severity.\n• Code submissions with diff vs. starter, run logs, test pass/fail.\n• Viva / subjective answers with AI-generated rubric scoring.\n• Side Eye snapshots (consented) and room-scan summary.\n\nAssessment-level (PDF + CSV + JSON):\n• Leaderboard, score distribution, percentile bands.\n• Integrity heatmap across the cohort.\n• Similarity clusters with linked candidate IDs.\n• Section difficulty calibration.\n\nSharing:\n• Public verifiable integrity reports via signed URL — external auditors confirm the chain of custody without needing a Parikshaa account.\n• CSV / JSON pulls via API or webhook for ATS, LMS, or in-house BI dashboards.\n• Bulk export of an entire drive in one ZIP.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an account to start learning?",
    answer:
      "Most learning content is browsable as a guest. To save progress, earn XP, join contests, or attempt invited assessments you'll need a free account — sign up takes under 30 seconds with email or Google.",
  },
