    difficulty: "Easy",
    conceptId: "classes-objects",
    answer: `## Class vs Object

### Class
A **class** is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects.

### Object
An **object** is an instance of a class - a concrete entity created from the class blueprint.

\`\`\`java
// Class - the blueprint
class Car {
    String brand;
    int speed;
    
    void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
    }
}

// Objects - instances of Car
Car myCar = new Car();    // Object 1
Car yourCar = new Car();  // Object 2
\`\`\`

### Analogy
- **Class**: Architectural blueprint for a house
- **Object**: Actual house built from that blueprint`,
    options: [
      { text: "Class is a blueprint, object is an instance of that blueprint", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "They are the same thing", isCorrect: false },

    id: 2,
    title: "What is a constructor?",
    text: "Explain constructors and their types in OOP.",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    conceptId: "classes-objects",
    answer: `## Constructors

A **constructor** is a special method that initializes an object when it's created.

### Types of Constructors

#### 1. Default Constructor
\`\`\`java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person() {
        name = "Unknown";
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Parameterized Constructor
\`\`\`java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Copy Constructor
\`\`\`java
class Person {
    String name;
    Person(Person other) {
        this.name = other.name;
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Key Points
- Same name as the class
- No return type
- Called automatically on object creation
- Can be overloaded`,
    options: [
      { text: "A special method that initializes objects when created", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "A method that destroys objects", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "A method that can only return integers", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "A static method", isCorrect: false },
    ],

  // Inheritance
  {
    id: 101,
    title: "What are the types of inheritance?",
    text: "Explain different types of inheritance in OOP.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    conceptId: "inheritance",
    answer: `## Types of Inheritance

### 1. Single Inheritance
One child inherits from one parent.
\`\`\`
Parent → Child
\`\`\`

### 2. Multilevel Inheritance
Chain of inheritance.
\`\`\`
Grandparent → Parent → Child
\`\`\`

### 3. Hierarchical Inheritance
Multiple children from one parent.
\`\`\`
     Parent
    /      \\
Child1   Child2
\`\`\`

### 4. Multiple Inheritance
One child from multiple parents (not in Java, use interfaces).
\`\`\`
Parent1  Parent2
    \\    /
     Child
\`\`\`

### 5. Hybrid Inheritance
Combination of above types.

### Java Example
\`\`\`java
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }      // Single
class Puppy extends Dog { }       // Multilevel
class Cat extends Animal { }      // Hierarchical
\`\`\``,

      { text: "Single, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Multiple, Hybrid", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Only single inheritance exists", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Public, Private, Protected", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Static and Dynamic", isCorrect: false },
    ],

    id: 102,
    title: "What is the diamond problem?",
    text: "Explain the diamond problem in multiple inheritance.",
    difficulty: "Hard",
    conceptId: "inheritance",
    answer: `## The Diamond Problem

The diamond problem occurs in multiple inheritance when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor.

\`\`\`
       A
      / \\
     B   C
      \\ /
       D
\`\`\`

### The Issue
If \`A\` has a method \`foo()\`, and both \`B\` and \`C\` inherit it (or override it), which version does \`D\` get?

### Solutions

#### 1. Java's Approach - Interfaces
\`\`\`java
interface A { default void foo() { } }
interface B extends A { }
interface C extends A { }
class D implements B, C {
    // Must override if B and C both override foo()
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. C++ Virtual Inheritance
\`\`\`cpp
class A { };
class B : virtual public A { };
class C : virtual public A { };
class D : public B, public C { }; // Only one copy of A
\`\`\`

#### 3. Python's MRO (Method Resolution Order)
Uses C3 linearization to determine method lookup order.`,
    options: [
      { text: "Ambiguity when a class inherits from two classes with a common ancestor", isCorrect: true },

  // Polymorphism
  {
    id: 201,
    title: "What is the difference between method overloading and overriding?",
    text: "Explain compile-time vs runtime polymorphism.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    conceptId: "polymorphism",
    answer: `## Method Overloading vs Overriding

### Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism)
Same method name, different parameters in the **same class**.

\`\`\`java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
    int add(int a, int b, int c) { return a + b + c; }
}
\`\`\`

### Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
Same method signature in **parent and child class**.

\`\`\`java
class Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void speak() { System.out.println("Woof!"); }
}

Animal a = new Dog();
a.speak(); // "Woof!" - decided at runtime
\`\`\`

| Feature | Overloading | Overriding |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Classes | Same class | Different classes |
| Binding | Compile-time | Runtime |
| Parameters | Must differ | Must be same |
| Return type | Can differ | Must be same (or covariant) |`,
    options: [
      { text: "Overloading: same name different params; Overriding: same signature in child class", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "They are the same thing", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Overloading requires inheritance", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Overriding happens at compile time", isCorrect: false },

  // Encapsulation
  {
    id: 301,
    title: "What is encapsulation and why is it important?",
    text: "Explain data hiding and access modifiers.",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    conceptId: "encapsulation",
    answer: `## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), and restricting direct access to some components.

### Implementation
\`\`\`java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance;  // Hidden data
    
    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    
    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
    
    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {
            balance -= amount;
        }
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Benefits
1. **Data Protection**: Prevents invalid modifications
2. **Flexibility**: Internal implementation can change
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and debug
4. **Control**: Validate data before changes`,

  // Abstraction
  {
    id: 401,
    title: "What is the difference between abstract class and interface?",
    text: "Compare abstract classes and interfaces.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    conceptId: "abstraction",
    answer: `## Abstract Class vs Interface

| Feature | Abstract Class | Interface |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Methods | Abstract & concrete | Abstract (default/static since Java 8) |
| Variables | Any type | public static final only |
| Inheritance | Single | Multiple |
| Constructor | Yes | No |
| Access modifiers | Any | public only |

### When to use Abstract Class
- Share code among related classes
- Need non-public members
- Need non-static/non-final fields

### When to use Interface
- Define a contract
- Multiple inheritance needed
- Unrelated classes share behavior

\`\`\`java
abstract class Animal {
    protected String name;
    abstract void speak();
    void sleep() { System.out.println("Zzz"); }
}

interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird extends Animal implements Flyable {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Tweet"); }
    public void fly() { System.out.println("Flying"); }
}

    title: "What is the Single Responsibility Principle?",
    text: "Explain SRP with examples.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    conceptId: "solid",
    answer: `## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only one reason to change.

### Bad Example
\`\`\`java
class Employee {
    void calculateSalary() { }
    void saveToDatabase() { }
    void generateReport() { }
}
// This class has 3 responsibilities!
\`\`\`

### Good Example
\`\`\`java
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    // Only employee data
}

class SalaryCalculator {
    void calculate(Employee e) { }
}

class EmployeeRepository {
    void save(Employee e) { }
}

class ReportGenerator {
    void generate(Employee e) { }
}

    answer: `## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Bad Example
\`\`\`java
class AreaCalculator {
    double calculate(Object shape) {
        if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {
            // calculate rectangle
        } else if (shape instanceof Circle) {
            // calculate circle
        }
        // Must modify for each new shape!
    }
}
\`\`\`

### Good Example
\`\`\`java
interface Shape {
    double area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public double area() { return width * height; }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public double area() { return Math.PI * radius * radius; }
}

class AreaCalculator {

    answer: `## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

### Bad Example
\`\`\`java
class Rectangle {
    void setWidth(int w) { this.width = w; }
    void setHeight(int h) { this.height = h; }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
    void setWidth(int w) {

    }
}

// Client code expects Rectangle behavior
Rectangle r = new Square();
r.setWidth(5);
r.setHeight(10);
// Expected area: 50, Actual: 100
\`\`\`

### Good Example
\`\`\`java
interface Shape {
    int area();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    // Rectangle implementation
}

class Square implements Shape {
    // Square implementation
}

    answer: `## Dynamic Dispatch

Dynamic dispatch determines which implementation to call at runtime based on the actual object type.

### Virtual Method Table (vtable)
\`\`\`java
class Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("..."); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void speak() { System.out.println("Woof!"); }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void speak() { System.out.println("Meow!"); }
}

// Runtime polymorphism
Animal[] animals = { new Dog(), new Cat() };
for (Animal a : animals) {
    a.speak();  // Dispatched at runtime
}
// Output: Woof! Meow!
\`\`\`

### How It Works
1. Each object has a pointer to its class's vtable
2. vtable contains pointers to actual method implementations
3. At runtime, correct method is looked up via vtable

    text: "Explain use cases for abstraction.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    conceptId: "abstraction",
    answer: `## When to Use Abstraction

### Use Abstract Classes When:
1. You want to share code among closely related classes
2. You need non-public members or non-final fields
3. You want to provide common implementation

\`\`\`java
abstract class Vehicle {
    protected int speed;
    
    public void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
    }
    
    abstract void fuelType();  // Must implement
}
\`\`\`

### Use Interfaces When:
1. Unrelated classes need to share behavior
2. You need multiple inheritance
3. You want to specify a contract

\`\`\`java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

class Bird implements Flyable { }
class Airplane implements Flyable { }
class Superhero implements Flyable { }
\`\`\`

### Real-World Example
\`\`\`java
// Abstract class for template method pattern
abstract class DataProcessor {
    public final void process() {
        readData();      // Template method
        processData();
        saveData();
    }
    
    abstract void readData();
    abstract void processData();
    abstract void saveData();

  // More Classes & Objects
  {
    id: 3,
    title: "What is the 'this' keyword?",
    text: "Explain the uses of 'this' in Java.",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    conceptId: "classes-objects",
    answer: `## The 'this' Keyword

'this' refers to the current object instance.

### Uses

#### 1. Distinguish instance variables from parameters
\`\`\`java
class Person {
    private String name;
    
    public Person(String name) {
        this.name = name;  // this.name is instance variable
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 2. Call another constructor
\`\`\`java
class Rectangle {
    private int width, height;
    
    public Rectangle() {
        this(1, 1);  // Call parameterized constructor
    }
    
    public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 3. Pass current object as argument
\`\`\`java
class Node {
    void addToList(List<Node> list) {
        list.add(this);
    }
}
\`\`\`

#### 4. Return current object (fluent interface)
\`\`\`java
class Builder {
    Builder setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        return this;
    }
}
\`\`\``,
    options: [
      { text: "Reference to the current object instance", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Reference to the parent class", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "A static reference", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Same as 'super'", isCorrect: false },
    ],
  },

    title: "What are static members?",
    text: "Explain static variables and methods.",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    conceptId: "classes-objects",
    answer: `## Static Members

Static members belong to the class, not instances.

### Static Variables
\`\`\`java
class Counter {
    private static int count = 0;  // Shared across all instances
    
    public Counter() {
        count++;
    }
    
    public static int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}

new Counter();
new Counter();
Counter.getCount();  // Returns 2
\`\`\`

### Static Methods
- Cannot access instance variables directly
- Cannot use 'this' keyword
- Called on the class, not objects

\`\`\`java
class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}

MathUtils.add(5, 3);  // No object needed
\`\`\`

### Static Blocks
\`\`\`java
class Database {
    static Connection conn;
    
    static {
        // Runs once when class is loaded
        conn = createConnection();
    }
}
\`\`\``,
    options: [
      { text: "Members that belong to the class, shared across all instances", isCorrect: true },
      { text: "Members that cannot change", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Members that are always private", isCorrect: false },
      { text: "Same as final members", isCorrect: false },
    ],

    answer: `## Method Hiding vs Overriding

### Method Overriding (Instance Methods)
Runtime polymorphism - actual object type determines which method runs.

\`\`\`java
class Parent {
    void greet() { System.out.println("Parent"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void greet() { System.out.println("Child"); }
}

Parent p = new Child();
p.greet();  // Prints "Child" (runtime dispatch)
\`\`\`

### Method Hiding (Static Methods)
Compile-time binding - reference type determines which method runs.

\`\`\`java
class Parent {
    static void staticGreet() { System.out.println("Parent"); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    static void staticGreet() { System.out.println("Child"); }
}

Parent p = new Child();
p.staticGreet();  // Prints "Parent" (compile-time)
\`\`\`
