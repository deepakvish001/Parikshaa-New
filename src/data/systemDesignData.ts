    topicId: "horizontal-scaling",
    answer: `## Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)

Horizontal scaling means adding more machines to your resource pool to handle increased load.

### Key Characteristics
- Add more servers/instances
- Distribute load across multiple machines
- No single point of failure
- Better fault tolerance

### Example
\`\`\`
Before: 1 server handling 1000 requests/sec
After:  4 servers each handling 250 requests/sec
\`\`\`

### When to Use
- Web servers behind load balancer
- Stateless applications
- When vertical scaling reaches limits`,

    text: "Explain vertical scaling and its limitations.",
    difficulty: "Easy",
    categoryId: "scalability",
    topicId: "vertical-scaling",
    answer: `## Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)

Vertical scaling means adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing machine.

### Advantages
- Simpler to implement
- No code changes needed
- No distributed system complexity

### Limitations
- Hardware limits (can't add infinite RAM)
- Single point of failure
- Downtime during upgrades
- Expensive high-end hardware

### When to Use
- Database servers (initially)
- Legacy applications
- Quick fixes for capacity`,

    difficulty: "Easy",
    categoryId: "load-balancing",
    topicId: "lb-algorithms",
    answer: `## Load Balancer

A load balancer distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

### Key Functions
- Distribute traffic evenly
- Health monitoring
- SSL termination
- Session persistence

### Common Algorithms
- **Round Robin**: Requests distributed sequentially
- **Least Connections**: Routes to server with fewest active connections
- **IP Hash**: Routes based on client IP
- **Weighted**: Servers get traffic proportional to their capacity`,

    answer: `## L4 vs L7 Load Balancing

### Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
- Works with TCP/UDP
- Faster (less processing)
- Routes based on IP and port
- Cannot inspect packet content

### Layer 7 (Application Layer)
- Works with HTTP/HTTPS
- Can inspect request content
- Routes based on URL, headers, cookies
- More intelligent routing decisions

### Use Cases
- **L4**: High-performance, simple routing
- **L7**: Content-based routing, API gateway, microservices`,
    options: [
      { text: "L4 routes by IP/port, L7 routes by content/URL", isCorrect: true },

    difficulty: "Medium",
    categoryId: "caching",
    topicId: "cache-eviction",
    answer: `## Cache Eviction Policies

When cache is full, we need strategies to remove items.

### Common Policies
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Removes least recently accessed items
- **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**: Removes least frequently accessed items
- **FIFO (First In First Out)**: Removes oldest items
- **TTL (Time To Live)**: Items expire after set time

### Comparison
| Policy | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| LRU | General purpose, web caching |
| LFU | Popular content caching |
| FIFO | Simple queue-like access |
| TTL | Time-sensitive data |`,

    difficulty: "Medium",
    categoryId: "databases",
    topicId: "sharding",
    answer: `## Database Sharding

Sharding is horizontal partitioning of data across multiple database instances.

### How It Works
- Data is split based on a shard key
- Each shard holds a subset of total data
- Application routes queries to correct shard

### Sharding Strategies
- **Range-based**: Shard by value ranges (A-M, N-Z)
- **Hash-based**: Shard by hash of key
- **Directory-based**: Lookup table for routing

### Benefits
- Horizontal scalability
- Improved query performance
- Geographic distribution

### Challenges
- Cross-shard queries are complex
- Rebalancing shards
- Maintaining consistency`,

    text: "Explain the CAP theorem and its implications.",
    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "databases",
    topicId: "sql-vs-nosql",
    answer: `## CAP Theorem

In a distributed system, you can only guarantee 2 of 3 properties:

### The Three Properties
- **Consistency**: All nodes see the same data at the same time
- **Availability**: Every request receives a response
- **Partition Tolerance**: System works despite network failures

### Trade-offs
- **CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)**: MongoDB, Redis
- **AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance)**: Cassandra, DynamoDB
- **CA (Consistency + Availability)**: Traditional RDBMS (single node)

### In Practice
Network partitions are unavoidable, so choose between C and A.`,

    difficulty: "Medium",
    categoryId: "microservices",
    topicId: "api-gateway",
    answer: `## API Gateway

An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests in a microservices architecture.

### Key Responsibilities
- **Request routing**: Routes to appropriate service
- **Authentication**: Validates tokens, API keys
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse
- **Load balancing**: Distributes traffic
- **Caching**: Reduces backend load
- **Protocol translation**: REST to gRPC, etc.

### Popular Solutions
- Kong, AWS API Gateway, Nginx, Zuul

### Benefits
- Simplified client interface
- Centralized cross-cutting concerns
- Decouples clients from services`,

    text: "Explain the Circuit Breaker pattern and its states.",
    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "microservices",
    topicId: "circuit-breaker",
    answer: `## Circuit Breaker Pattern

Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems by failing fast when a service is unavailable.

### States
1. **Closed**: Normal operation, requests pass through
2. **Open**: Service failing, requests fail immediately
3. **Half-Open**: Testing if service recovered

### How It Works
\`\`\`
Closed → (failures exceed threshold) → Open
Open → (timeout expires) → Half-Open
Half-Open → (test succeeds) → Closed
Half-Open → (test fails) → Open
\`\`\`

### Benefits
- Prevents resource exhaustion
- Fast failure instead of timeout
- Allows service recovery time

### Implementations
- Hystrix (deprecated), Resilience4j, Polly`,

    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "messaging",
    topicId: "event-driven",
    answer: `## Event-Driven Architecture

A design pattern where services communicate through events rather than direct calls.

### Key Concepts
- **Event**: Something that happened (OrderPlaced, UserCreated)
- **Producer**: Emits events
- **Consumer**: Reacts to events
- **Event Bus**: Routes events (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

### Patterns
- **Event Notification**: Simple notification
- **Event-Carried State Transfer**: Event contains all needed data
- **Event Sourcing**: Store state as sequence of events
- **CQRS**: Separate read and write models

### Benefits
- Loose coupling
- Scalability
- Resilience
- Audit trail`,

    answer: `## Write-Through vs Write-Back Caching

### Write-Through
- Data written to cache AND database simultaneously
- Higher latency on writes
- Strong consistency
- No data loss on cache failure

### Write-Back (Write-Behind)
- Data written to cache first, then async to database
- Lower write latency
- Risk of data loss on cache failure
- Eventual consistency

### Comparison
| Aspect | Write-Through | Write-Back |

    answer: `## Database Replication

Copying and maintaining database objects in multiple databases.

### Master-Slave (Primary-Replica)
- One master handles writes
- Slaves replicate from master
- Slaves handle read queries
- Good for read-heavy workloads

### Multi-Master
- Multiple nodes can accept writes
- More complex conflict resolution
- Better write availability

### Synchronous vs Asynchronous
- **Sync**: Waits for all replicas, strong consistency
- **Async**: Returns immediately, eventual consistency

### Benefits
- High availability
- Read scalability

    answer: `## Rate Limiter Design

### Common Algorithms

#### Token Bucket
- Tokens added at fixed rate
- Request consumes token
- Allows bursts up to bucket size

#### Leaky Bucket
- Requests enter bucket, processed at fixed rate
- Overflow requests dropped
- Smooth output rate

#### Fixed Window Counter
- Count requests in fixed time windows
- Reset counter at window boundary
- Simple but can allow 2x rate at boundary

#### Sliding Window Log
- Store timestamp of each request
- Count requests in sliding window
- Memory intensive

#### Sliding Window Counter
- Hybrid of fixed window and sliding log
- Weighted count from current and previous window
- Good balance of accuracy and efficiency

### Implementation
\`\`\`java
class TokenBucket {
    private int tokens;
    private int maxTokens;
    private long lastRefill;

- **Auto-increment**: Simple but predictable
- **Base62 encoding**: a-z, A-Z, 0-9 (62 chars)
- **Hash-based**: MD5/SHA256 with collision handling
- **Distributed ID**: Snowflake ID for uniqueness

#### Database Schema
\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE urls (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    short_code VARCHAR(10) UNIQUE,
    original_url TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,

    topicId: "distributed-consensus",
    answer: `## Raft Consensus Algorithm

Raft is a consensus algorithm designed to be understandable. It ensures all nodes in a distributed system agree on the same state.

### Key Concepts

#### Leader Election
- Nodes are: Leader, Follower, or Candidate
- Leader sends heartbeats to maintain authority
- If followers don't receive heartbeat, they become candidates
- Candidate requests votes; majority wins

#### Log Replication
1. Client sends command to leader
2. Leader appends to its log
3. Leader replicates to followers
4. Once majority confirms, entry is committed
5. Leader applies and responds to client

### Terms
- **Term**: Logical clock, increments with each election
- **Committed**: Entry replicated to majority
- **Applied**: Entry executed on state machine

### Safety Guarantees
- Only one leader per term
- Leaders never delete/overwrite entries
- If entry committed, all future leaders have it

### vs Paxos
- Raft is more understandable
- Raft has stronger leader
- Similar performance in practice`,

    answer: `## CAP Theorem Deep Dive

### The Theorem
During network partition, choose between:
- **Consistency**: All reads get most recent write
- **Availability**: Every request gets a response

### Real-World Trade-offs

#### CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)
- MongoDB, Redis Cluster, HBase, Zookeeper
- Reject writes during partition
- Better for: Financial transactions, inventory

#### AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)
- Cassandra, DynamoDB, CouchDB
- Allow writes during partition, resolve later
- Better for: Social media, analytics

### Consistency Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Strong | Reads see latest write |
| Eventual | Reads eventually see write |
| Causal | Respects causality ordering |
| Read-your-writes | See your own writes |

### PACELC Extension
- If Partition: choose A or C
- Else (normal operation): choose Latency or Consistency
- Example: Cassandra is PA/EL (AP, but tunable consistency normally)

A saga is a sequence of local transactions where each transaction updates a service and publishes an event to trigger the next.

### Problem
Distributed transactions (2PC) don't scale well and create tight coupling.

### Types of Sagas

#### Choreography
- Services listen to events and react
- No central coordinator
- Decentralized, loosely coupled
- Harder to understand flow

#### Orchestration
- Central orchestrator directs the saga
- Sends commands to services
- Easier to understand and debug
- Single point of failure risk

### Example: Order Saga

\`\`\`
1. Order Service: Create order (PENDING)
2. Payment Service: Reserve payment
3. Inventory Service: Reserve stock
4. Order Service: Confirm order (CONFIRMED)

If step 3 fails:
3a. Inventory: Rollback (no-op)
2a. Payment: Compensate (release payment)
1a. Order: Compensate (cancel order)
\`\`\`

### Compensating Transactions
- Each step has a compensation action
- Compensations undo the effect (semantically)
- Must be idempotent

### Challenges
- Partial failures and compensation
- Ordering guarantees
- Observability and debugging`,

    answer: `## Service Mesh

A dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication.

### Architecture

#### Data Plane
- Sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy)
- Deployed alongside each service
- Intercepts all network traffic
- Handles: routing, load balancing, security

#### Control Plane
- Manages and configures proxies
- Examples: Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect
- Provides: configuration, certificates, policies

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Traffic Management | Routing, load balancing, retries |
| Security | mTLS, authentication, authorization |
| Observability | Metrics, tracing, logging |
| Resilience | Circuit breakers, timeouts, retries |

### Example: Istio Architecture
\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Control Plane              │
│  (Istiod: Pilot, Citadel, Galley)   │

    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "messaging",
    topicId: "exactly-once",
    answer: `## Message Delivery Guarantees

### At-Most-Once
- Message delivered 0 or 1 time
- Fire and forget
- No retries
- May lose messages
- Use case: Metrics where loss is acceptable

### At-Least-Once
- Message delivered 1 or more times
- Retry on failure
- May duplicate messages
- Consumer must be idempotent
- Use case: Most applications

### Exactly-Once
- Message delivered exactly 1 time
- Hardest to achieve
- Usually involves transactions

### Achieving Exactly-Once

#### Idempotent Consumers
\`\`\`java
// Store processed message IDs
if (processedIds.contains(messageId)) {
    return; // Already processed
}
process(message);
processedIds.add(messageId);
\`\`\`

#### Transactional Outbox
1. Write to DB and outbox table in transaction
2. Separate process reads outbox and publishes
3. Delete from outbox after confirmation

#### Kafka Exactly-Once
- Idempotent producers (dedup by sequence number)
- Transactional producers (atomic writes)
- Read-process-write transactions

### Trade-offs
| Guarantee | Complexity | Performance | Use Case |

    text: "Explain consistent hashing for distributed systems.",
    difficulty: "Medium",
    categoryId: "scalability",
    topicId: "database-scaling",
    answer: `## Consistent Hashing

A technique for distributing data across nodes where adding/removing nodes minimizes data movement.

### Problem with Simple Hashing
\`\`\`
hash(key) % num_servers
\`\`\`
Adding/removing server remaps almost all keys!

### Consistent Hashing Solution

#### The Ring
- Hash space forms a ring (0 to 2^32-1)
- Nodes placed on ring by hash(node_id)
- Keys placed on ring by hash(key)
- Key goes to first node clockwise from its position

#### Adding a Node
- Only keys between new node and predecessor move
- ~1/N keys need to move (vs almost all)

#### Virtual Nodes
- Each physical node gets multiple positions
- Better load distribution
- Handles heterogeneous nodes

### Example
\`\`\`
        ┌───────────────┐
        │     Key1      │
        ▼               │
    ┌──────┐        ┌──────┐
    │Node A│        │Node C│
    └──┬───┘        └──────┘
       │        Ring
       │     ┌──────┐
       └────►│Node B│ ← Key1 stored here
             └──────┘

    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "hld-case-studies",
    topicId: "design-twitter",
    answer: `## Design Twitter

### Functional Requirements
- Post tweets (text, images, videos)
- Follow users
- View home timeline (tweets from followed users)
- Search tweets and users

### Core Components

#### Tweet Service
- Write-heavy for posting
- Store tweet content, metadata
- Tweet ID generator (Snowflake)

#### Timeline Service
- **Fan-out on Write**: Pre-compute timelines when tweet posted
- **Fan-out on Read**: Compute timeline at read time
- Hybrid approach for celebrities

#### Social Graph Service
- Store follow relationships
- Handle follow/unfollow operations
- Query followers/following

### Data Flow
\`\`\`
User Posts Tweet → Tweet Service → Cache + DB
                 ↓
           Fan-out Service → Push to followers' timelines
                 ↓
           Timeline Cache (Redis)
\`\`\`

### Scale Considerations
- 500M tweets/day = ~6000 tweets/sec
- Read-heavy: 100x more reads than writes
- Celebrity problem: 100M+ followers`,

    difficulty: "Hard",
    categoryId: "hld-case-studies",
    topicId: "design-twitter",
    answer: `## Twitter Fan-out Strategies

### Fan-out on Write (Push Model)
When user posts tweet:
1. Identify all followers
2. Insert tweet into each follower's timeline cache
3. Timeline ready when user opens app

**Pros:**
- Fast reads (O(1) for timeline)
- Good for users with few followers

**Cons:**
- Celebrity problem (100M followers = 100M writes)
- Wasted work if followers don't read

### Fan-out on Read (Pull Model)
When user opens timeline:
1. Fetch list of followed users
2. Query recent tweets from each
3. Merge and sort

**Pros:**
- No wasted computation
- Works for celebrities

**Cons:**
- Slow reads
- High read amplification

### Hybrid Approach (Twitter's Solution)
- **Regular users**: Fan-out on write
- **Celebrities** (>10K followers): Fan-out on read
- Merge both at read time

\`\`\`
Home Timeline = Cached Timeline + Real-time Celebrity Tweets
\`\`\`

### Optimization
- Use Redis for timeline cache
- Keep only recent ~800 tweets per user
- Lazy loading for older tweets`,

                        CDN Origin
\`\`\`

### Delivery Optimization
- **CDN**: Edge caching worldwide
- **Progressive JPEG**: Fast initial load
- **WebP format**: 30% smaller than JPEG
- **Lazy loading**: Load as user scrolls

### Database Schema
\`\`\`sql
Photos: id, user_id, storage_path, created_at
PhotoVersions: photo_id, size, path, width, height

### Evolution
- 2010-2016: Chronological feed
- 2016+: Algorithmic ranking

### Feed Architecture

#### Candidate Generation
1. Fetch posts from followed users (last 48 hours)
2. Add recommended posts (Explore)
3. Insert ads at intervals

#### Ranking System (ML-based)
\`\`\`
Features:
- User-author relationship (interaction history)
- Post features (likes, comments, recency)
- User features (past behavior, interests)
- Context (time of day, device)

Score = ML_Model(features) → probability of engagement
\`\`\`

#### Feed Composition
\`\`\`
Ranked Posts → Diversity Filter → Ad Insertion → Final Feed
\`\`\`

### Caching Strategy
- Pre-compute top candidates for active users
- Cache in Redis with TTL
- Refresh on pull-to-refresh

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket for new posts from close friends
- Push notifications for high-priority content

### A/B Testing
- Constantly test ranking signals
